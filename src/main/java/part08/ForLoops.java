// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called ForLoops.
//    Leave the "package part08;" line and the class line alone. Type everything else.
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. The README shows an example.

public class ForLoops {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        for (int i = 10; i >= 0;) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i -= 2;
        }
        System.out.println("Happy New Year!");
    }
